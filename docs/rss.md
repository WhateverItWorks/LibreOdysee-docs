Librarian provides RSS feeds for channels. You can add them to your RSS reader by pasting in the channel URL (if your RSS app supports it), using the channel URL with /rss at the end, or using the "Subscribe" button. You can also enable enclosures by adding `?enclosure=true` to view content inside your RSS reader (if it is supported).
