These rules have been copied from [Invidious](https://docs.invidious.io/Invidious-Instances.md) with some changes.

1. Instances MUST have been updated in the last month. An instance that hasn't been updated in the last month is considered unmaintained and is removed from the list.

2. Instances MUST be served via domain name.

3. Instances MUST be served via HTTPS/HSTS (or/and onion).

4. Instances using any DDoS Protection / MITM MUST be marked as such (eg: Cloudflare, DDoS-Guard...).

5. Instances using any type of anti-bot protection MUST be marked as such.

6. Instances MAY use privacy analytics (Plausible).

7. Any system whose goal is to modify the content served to the user (i.e web server HTML rewrite) is considered the same as modifying the source code. Instances running modified source code: 
    - MUST respect the AGPL by publishing their source code and stating their changes
    - MUST publish any later modification in a timely manner 

8. Instances MUST NOT serve ads NOR promote products.

9. Instances MUST fill out the Instance privacy section of the config file.

NOTE: We reserve the right to decline any instance from being added to the list, and to remove or ban any instance that repeatedly breaks the aforementioned rules.
